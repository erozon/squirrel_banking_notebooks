    "Squirrels in nature store nuts for the winter. Throughout these explorations, squirrels represent agents who may forego an immediate reward (nuts) in favour of a delayed alternative. Assertions made about squirrels are to be interpreted as descriptions of how squirrels in the model behave, and are not necessarily zoologically accurate."

    "A squirrel forrages daily for nuts, finding either $0$, $1$, or $2$ nuts, with probabilities $p_0$, $p_1$, and $p_2$ respectively. A squirrel who consumes $0$ nuts dies. A squirrel who finds $1$ nut keeps itself alive until the following day. And a squirrel who finds $2$ nuts not only stays alive, but produces an offspring who the next day proceeds to live a life entirely independently of its parent. "

    "Suppose we allow our squirrel to bank nuts. By keeping a cache of nuts saved, a squirrel may survive despite finding $0$ nuts, by dipping into its reserves and consuming from the cache. Banking helps a squirrel to live a longer life. However, banking also delays reproduction. All else equal, evolutionary processes favour faster reproduction and not dying (enabling one to reproduce more).  "
