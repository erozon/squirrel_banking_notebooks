    "Roughly speaking, patience describes an individual's (more generally, an agent's) willingness to wait for a delayed reward. A reward of magnitude $r$ received at delay $t > 0$ is typically assumed to be of less intrinsic value to the recipient than if the same reward $r$ were received with no delay ($t = 0$). A discounting function quantifies the extent to which an individual perceives the relative value of a reward changing as delay to receipt varies. "
